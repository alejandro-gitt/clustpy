    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX Graph

    communities : list or iterable of set of nodes
        These node sets must represent a partition of G's nodes.

    weight : string or None, optional (default="weight")
            The edge attribute that holds the numerical value used
            as a weight. If None or an edge does not have that attribute,
            then that edge has weight 1.

    resolution : float (default=1)
        If resolution is less than 1, modularity favors larger communities.
        Greater than 1 favors smaller communities.

    -------

        The modularity of the paritition.

    ------
    NotAPartition
